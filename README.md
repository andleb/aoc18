# aoc18
Advent of Code 2018. Code is provided as close to as it was at the time of the solution as possible. I also abstained from using external libraries, e.g. for graph-based problems. Each subfolder represents a problem/a day in the competition with the input included in a text file. The solution can be obtained by simply running the Python script. Note that the input might be personalized to each participant.
